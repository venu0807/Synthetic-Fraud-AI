# **Synthetic Data Augmentation for Fraud Detection**

## **Project Overview**

This project addresses the challenge of data imbalance in fraud detection by using Generative AI, specifically a **CTGAN (Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Network)** model, to create synthetic data. The synthetic data is used to augment the limited number of real fraud cases, which significantly improves the performance of a machine learning classifier.

## **Methodology**

1. **Data Loading**: The creditcard.csv dataset is loaded and analyzed for its structure and class distribution.  
2. **Generative AI**: A **CTGAN model** is trained on the minority class (fraudulent transactions) to learn its underlying data distribution.  
3. **Data Augmentation**: The trained CTGAN model generates a large number of synthetic fraud transactions. This new data is combined with the original dataset to create a more balanced augmented\_dataset.csv.  
4. **Classifier Training**: A **Random Forest Classifier** is trained on the augmented dataset to learn the patterns of both genuine and fraudulent transactions.  
5. **Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated using key metrics such as **precision, recall, and ROC AUC score**, demonstrating a significant improvement in fraud detection capability.
